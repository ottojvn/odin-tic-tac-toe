# Tic Tac Toe

This is a project I created as part of the Odin Project course, which helped me learn about modularization and objects using the Factory pattern.

## About the Game

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 or larger grid, in which players take turns marking spaces on the grid with their symbol (usually X or O). The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In this version of the game, the player can select the board length from 3 up to 12 squares, and each player can be controlled by a human or by a bot with varying difficulties.

## How to Play

Choose the board size and player types
The game will begin with Player 1 (X) making the first move

The game ends when a player gets three symbols in a row or there are no more empty spaces on the board
If a player wins, the game will display a message announcing the winner and the game will end
If the game ends in a tie, the game will display a message announcing the tie
